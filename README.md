# Loan Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project aims to build a loan prediction model using logistic regression. The model predicts whether a loan will be approved based on various features of the applicants.

## Team Members
- Mohammad Yesaullah Sheikh
- Emaan Arshad
- Tanisha Kataria

## Project Structure

- `Logistic Regresssion.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the logistic regression implementation.
- `Logistic Regresssion.py`: Python script for logistic regression.
- `streamlit_gui.py`: Python script for the Streamlit GUI.
- `loan_prediction.csv`: Dataset used for training the model.
- `loan_test.csv`: Dataset used for testing the model.
- `README.md`: This readme file.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages can be installed using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

To run the logistic regression implementation, open the `Logistic Regresssion.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

### Running the Python Script

To run the logistic regression using the Python script, execute the following command:
```bash
python Logistic\ Regresssion.py
```

### Running the Streamlit GUI

To run the Streamlit GUI, execute the following command:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_gui.py
```

## Data

The dataset used for this project is included in the repository:
- `loan_prediction.csv`: Contains the training data for loan predictions.
- `loan_test.csv`: Contains the test data for evaluating the model.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression for predicting loan approvals. The model performance can be evaluated using the provided confusion matrices and feature importance plots.
